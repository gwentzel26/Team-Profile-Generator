      ## Installation installation

      Git clone the repo on my github profile, use npm i inquirer to install the proper packages, and then use node index.js once you're in the working directory

      ## Usage

      To add a screenshot, create an assets/images folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

         md
          ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

          Once you use the node index.js command line, you will just need to follow the prompts given to you in the console
